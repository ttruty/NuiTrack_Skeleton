# NuiTrack_Skeleton
Using the NuiTrack middleware with unity project to track body and skeleton with depth camera
Made with Unity 5.6.2f

The Unity project shows a scene with a depth image in the upper right corner
and if a body is present the skeleton object is shown in the center.
It depends upon the NUITrack SDK, this is a modified sample provided by the SDK. 
and a depth sensor. I use the RealSense 415.

Where I hope to take this project:
* Angles of Bones that flex from a joint
* UI object that can be interacted with
* Acceration of certain bones and joints
* Fall detection
* Gesture control
* Voice recognition with MS Voice SDK integration
